# Security Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: This project provides remote terminal access to your system. Please understand the security implications before deploying.

## Overview

This project creates a web-accessible terminal interface to your local machine through a VPS proxy. While convenient for personal use, it inherently involves security trade-offs.

## Critical Security Points

### 1. **Remote Command Execution**
- This system allows full command execution on your laptop from any web browser
- Anyone with credentials can run ANY command as your user
- Consider this equivalent to giving SSH access to your machine

### 2. **Authentication**
- Basic HTTP authentication is used (username/password)
- Credentials are transmitted with each request (encrypted over HTTPS)
- No session management or rate limiting by default

### 3. **Network Exposure**
- Your laptop's terminal is exposed through your VPS
- Even with authentication, this increases your attack surface
- Reverse SSH tunnel maintains persistent connection

## Security Best Practices

### Mandatory Security Measures

1. **Use Strong Credentials**
   - Never use default passwords
   - Use long, random passphrases
   - Store credentials in `credentials.sh` (never commit this file)

2. **HTTPS Only**
   - Always access via HTTPS, never HTTP
   - Ensure your VPS nginx configuration enforces SSL

3. **Firewall Rules**
   - Restrict VPS access to specific IPs if possible
   - Use fail2ban or similar to prevent brute force attacks

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep ttyd, nginx, and SSH updated
   - Monitor for security advisories

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **IP Whitelisting**
   ```nginx
   location /terminal {
       allow 1.2.3.4;  # Your home IP
       allow 5.6.7.8;  # Your work IP
       deny all;
       # ... rest of config
   }
   ```

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Consider adding nginx auth_request module with 2FA
   - Or use VPN access to VPS as additional layer

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable nginx access logs for terminal endpoints
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Consider logging commands executed (privacy trade-off)

4. **Restricted Shell**
   - Consider using a restricted shell or container
   - Limit available commands if full access not needed

5. **Auto-disconnect**
   - Implement idle timeout in ttyd
   - Force re-authentication after period of inactivity

## Threat Model

This setup assumes:
- You trust your VPS provider
- Your VPS is reasonably secure
- You're the only user who should have access
- Your use case justifies the convenience/security trade-off

## NOT Suitable For:
- Multi-user environments
- Production servers
- Handling sensitive data
- Corporate environments without security review
- Compliance-regulated systems (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)

## Incident Response

If you suspect compromise:
1. Immediately kill ttyd process on laptop
2. Remove nginx configuration on VPS
3. Change all credentials
4. Review logs for unauthorized access
5. Check for any unauthorized changes to your system

## Responsible Disclosure

This is a personal project. If you discover security issues:
- Do not publicly disclose without attempting contact first
- Send details to the repository owner
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

## Disclaimer

This project prioritizes convenience for personal use. Users must understand and accept the security implications. The authors are not responsible for any security incidents resulting from use of this software.
